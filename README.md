# Middle - JS User Interface Library

Middle, is a revised and modernized version of my old project Flexer (from 2015). For now, only core and drag plugin "Dragger" exist here. Other revised library codes (Sorter, Dropper, Ranger, Elementer, etc), improvements and more detailed documentation and demo pages will added soon.

This project aims to provide a modern and performance-oriented ui experience.
